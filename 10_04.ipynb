        "We will make bias correction using the bias_correction function of the ambhas.stats library. We begin with importing the library. Then we generate some random numbers to apply the bias corrections. We deliberately modify the mean of the modeled variable, so that the bias correction method can be compared. As we can see, the mean of the modeled prediction was 2, while the mean of observed data is approximately 0 before applying bias correction. The mean of the bias adjusted modeled prediction has become approximately 0 after applying the CDF based bias correction."
