        "I started using Python in July 2010. I was looking for a programming language, which is:\n",
        "*    open source,\n",
        "*    capable of combining many codes/modules/softwares,\n",
        "*    easy to learn, and\n",
        "*    help is available on the internet. \n",
        "\n",
        "I came across Python and Perl, even though there might be many more options available. I googled the use of Python and Perl in the field of general scientific usage, hydrology, Geographic Information System (GIS), and statistics etc. Basically, I tried to search for the examples I thought I might be facing in the future. \n",
        "\n",
        "I somehow felt Python had more help related to my field and felt it to be the language of my need. I did not know at that time if my conclusions (in the areas mentioned above) about the Python versus Perl were true or not? But, now I am certain of making a good choice as I feel happy for choosing the Python for my work. Python has evolved a lot in the last decade and has become much more valuable for the kind of work I am into and find it to be fulfilling my requirements completely.\n",
        "\n",
        "After getting a lot of help from open source community, I felt that I should also make a small contribution into the free world. I tried to contribute in few areas, but could not go ahead because of my less knowledge in those areas. After spending extensive one year with Python, I thought to make some contribution into Python world. I wrote few small packages for the Python, and started writing this book.\n",
        "\n",
        "I tried the book to keep it very simple as I would like to have read some Python book. If you find something complicated, do let me know, I will try my best to simplify it. \n",
        "\n",
        "I hope that you will find this book helpful and enjoyable.\n",
